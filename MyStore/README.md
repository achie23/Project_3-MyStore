# MyStore

Building a frontend of an ecommerce website using Angular.
This is the final project of Udacity's Full Stack JavaScript Nanodegree.
It showcases the use of Angular in the development of an ecommerce website.
- This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.3.

Features of the app:

- Shows details of a product when product image is click
- Add product to cart, removes product from cart, clear cart and checkout the order


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
